# CISSP Practice Tests - Chapter 2: Asset Security (Domain 2) Answer Key

## Question 1
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Scoping is the process of determining which controls are appropriate to an organization, environment, or implementation. Bounds checking is the process of making sure that data does not overflow a variable. Data stewards provide oversight and data governance. Tailoring modifies controls to fit a specific situation or need.

---

## Question 2
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Business owners have to balance the need to provide value with regulatory, security, and other requirements. This makes the adoption of a common framework like COBIT attractive. Data owners are more likely to ask that those responsible for control selection identify a standard to use. Data processors are required to perform specific actions under regulations like the EU GDPR. Finally, in many organizations, data stewards are internal roles that oversee how data is used.

---

## Question 3
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The best option for Nadia is a cloud access security broker (CASB). A CASB is designed to sit between a cloud environment and the users who use it, and it provides monitoring and policy enforcement capabilities. A next-generation firewall (NGFW), an intrusion detection system (IDS), and a security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) tool could each provide some insight into what is going on, but they are not purpose built and designed for this like the CASB is. The NGFW and IDS are most likely to provide insight into traffic patterns and behaviors, while the SOAR is primarily intended to monitor other systems and centralize data for response, making it potentially the least useful in this specific scenario.

---

## Question 4
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Media is typically labeled with the highest classification level of data it contains. This prevents the data from being handled or accessed at a lower classification level. Data integrity requirements may be part of a classification process but don't independently drive labeling in a classification scheme.

---

## Question 5
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The need to protect sensitive data drives data classification. Classifying data allows organizations to focus on data that needs to be protected rather than spending effort on less important data. Remanence describes data left on media after an attempt is made to remove the data. Transmitting data isn't a driver for an administrative process to protect sensitive data, and clearing is a technical process for removing data from media.

---

## Question 6
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
A data retention policy can help to ensure that outdated data is purged, removing potential additional costs for discovery. Many organizations have aggressive retention policies to both reduce the cost of storage and limit the amount of data that is kept on hand and discoverable. Data retention policies are not designed to destroy incriminating data, and legal requirements for data retention must still be met.

---

## Question 7
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Custodians are delegated the role of handling day- to-day tasks by managing and overseeing how data is handled, stored, and protected. Data processors are systems used to process data. Business owners are typically project or system owners who are tasked with making sure systems provide value to their users or customers.

---

## Question 8
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
In a typical data life cycle, collection is the first stage, although some may replace collection with creation. Once collected, data can be analyzed, used, stored, and disposed of at the end of its useful life.

Policies may be created at any time, and organizations often have data before they have policies. Labels are added to data during the analysis, usage, or retention cycle.

---

## Question 9
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Security baselines provide a starting point to scope and tailor security controls to your organization's needs. They aren't always appropriate to specific organizational needs, they cannot ensure that systems are always in a secure state, and they do not prevent liability.

---

## Question 10
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Clearing describes preparing media for reuse. When media is cleared, unclassified data is written over all addressable locations on the media. Once that's completed, the media can be reused, although it may be possible to retrieve some of the original data using retrieval tools. Erasing is the deletion of files or media and may not include all of the data on the device or media, making it the worst choice here. Purging is a more intensive form of clearing for reuse in lower- security areas, and sanitization is a series of processes that removes data from a system or media while ensuring that the data is unrecoverable by any means.

---

## Question 11
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Sensitive data scanning tools are designed to scan for and flag sensitive data types using known formatting and structure. Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and other regularly structured data that follows known rules can be identified and then addressed as needed. Manual searching is a massive undertaking for an organization with even a relatively small amount of data; asset metadata needs to be set first and would have already been identified; and a SOAR is used to automate incident response and orchestrate security actions.

---

## Question 12
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Spare sectors, bad sectors, and space provided for wear leveling on SSDs (overprovisioned space) may all contain data that was written to the space that will not be cleared when the drive is wiped. This is a form of data remanence and is a concern for organizations that do not want data to potentially be accessible. Many wiping utilities deal only with currently addressable space on the drive. SSDs cannot be degaussed, and wear leveling space cannot be reliably used to hide data. These spaces are still addressable by the drive, although they may not be seen by the operating system.

---

## Question 13
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Commercial data classification often takes into account the value of the data, any regulatory or legal requirements that may apply to the data, and how long the data is useful—its life span. The impact to national security is more typically associated with government classification schemes.

---

## Question 14
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Data is often considered based on the data state that it is in. Data can be at rest (on a drive or other storage medium), in use and thus in memory or a buffer and often decrypted for use, or in transit over a network. Data that is resident in system memory is considered data in use.

---

## Question 15
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
A watermark is used to digitally label data and can be used to indicate ownership, as well as to assist a digital rights management (DRM) system in identifying data that should be protected. Encryption would have prevented the data from being accessed if it was lost, while classification is part of the set of security practices that can help make sure the right controls are in place. Finally, metadata is used to label data and might help a data loss prevention system flag it before it leaves your organization.

---

## Question 16
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
AES is a strong modern symmetric encryption algorithm that is appropriate for encrypting data at rest. TLS is frequently used to secure data when it is in transit. A virtual private network is not necessarily an encrypted connection and would be used for data in motion, while DES is an outdated algorithm and should not be used for data that needs strong security.

---

## Question 17
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Data loss prevention (DLP) systems can use labels on data to determine the appropriate controls to apply to the data. Most DLP systems won't modify labels in real time and typically don't work directly with firewalls to stop traffic. Deleting unlabeled data would cause big problems for organizations that haven't labeled every piece of data!

---

## Question 18
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The value of the data contained on media often exceeds the cost of the media, making more expensive media that may have a longer life span or additional capabilities like encryption support a good choice. While expensive media may be less likely to fail, the reason it makes sense is the value of the data, not just that it is less likely to fail. In general, the cost of the media doesn't have anything to do with the ease of encryption, and data integrity isn't ensured by better media.

---

## Question 19
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Destruction is the most complete method of ensuring that data cannot be exposed, and organizations often opt to destroy either the drive or the entire workstation or device to ensure that data cannot be recovered or exposed. Sanitization is a combination of processes that ensure that data from a system cannot be recovered by any means. Erasing and clearing are both prone to mistakes and technical problems that can result in remnant data and don't

make sense for systems that handle proprietary information.

---

## Question 20
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Common practice makes proprietary or confidential data the most sensitive data. Private data is internal business data that shouldn't be exposed but that doesn't meet the threshold for confidential or proprietary data. Sensitive data may help attackers or otherwise create risk and typically refers to any information that isn't public or unclassified, and public data is just that—data that is or can be made public.

---

## Question 21
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Data at rest is inactive data that is physically stored. Data in an IPsec tunnel or part of an e-commerce transaction is data in motion. Data in RAM is ephemeral and is not inactive.

---

## Question 22
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) provides the set of requirements for credit card processing systems. The Microsoft, NSA, and CIS baseline are all useful for building a Windows 11 security standard, but the PCI DSS standard is a better answer.

---

## Question 23
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
The CIS benchmarks are an example of a security baseline. A risk assessment would help identify which controls were needed, and proper system ownership is an important part of making sure baselines are implemented and maintained. Data labeling can help ensure that controls are applied to the right systems and data.

---

## Question 24
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Scoping involves selecting only the controls that are appropriate for your IT systems, while tailoring matches your organization's mission and the controls from a selected baseline. Baselining is the process of configuring a system or software to match a baseline or

building a baseline itself. Selection isn't a technical term used for any of these processes.

---

## Question 25
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The controls implemented from a security baseline should match the data classification of the data used or stored on the system. Custodians are trusted to ensure the day-to-day security of the data and should do so by ensuring that the baseline is met and maintained. Business owners often have a conflict of interest between functionality and data security, and of course, applying the same controls everywhere is expensive and may not meet business needs or be a responsible use of resources.

---

## Question 26
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
The third-party company is a data processor—they process data on behalf of Henry's company, which is a data controller. The data is collected about data subjects. Data owners are tasked with making decisions about data, such as who receives access to it and how it is used.

---

## Question 27
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Many organizations require the destruction of media that contains data at higher levels of classification. Often the cost of the media is lower than the potential costs of data exposure, and it is difficult to guarantee that reused media doesn't contain remnant data. Tapes can be erased by degaussing, but degaussing is not always fully effective. Bitrot describes the slow loss of data on aging media, while data permanence is a term sometimes used to describe the life span of data and media.

---

## Question 28
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
NIST Special Publication 800-122 defines PII as any information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, such as name, Social Security number, date and place of birth, mother's maiden name, biometric records, and other information that is linked or linkable to an individual such as medical,

educational, financial, and employment information. PHI is health-related information about a specific person, Social Security numbers are issued to individuals in the United States, and SII is a made-up term.

---

## Question 29
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Typically, data breaches cause the greatest reputational damage as a result of threats to data at rest. Data at rest with a high level of sensitivity is often encrypted to help prevent this. Decryption is not as significant of a threat if strong encryption is used and encryption keys are well secured. Insider threats are a risk, but the majority of insider threat issues are unintentional rather than intentional, making this risk less likely in most organizations.

---

## Question 30
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Full disk encryption only protects data at rest. Since it encrypts the full disk, it does not distinguish between labeled and unlabeled data.

---

## Question 31
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
This is an example of an end-of-support (EOS) scenario. The company is intentionally ending support and needs to address what happens to the devices next —secure disposal, destruction, or re-sale—depending on data security requirements and policies set by the company. EOL is when a device or software is no longer made or supported, in contrast to end of support, which may be when it is no longer serviced, including via patches, upgrades, or organizational maintenance. Planned obsolescence and device risk management are not terms that are used on the exam.

---

## Question 32
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Classification identifies the value of data to an organization. This can often help drive IT expenditure prioritization and could help with rough cost estimates if a breach occurred, but that's not the primary purpose. Finally, most breach laws call out specific data

types for notification rather than requiring organizations to classify data themselves.

---

## Question 33
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Downgrading systems and media is rare due to the difficulty of ensuring that sanitization is complete. The need to completely wipe (or destroy) the media that systems use means that the cost of reuse is often significant and may exceed the cost of purchasing a new system or media. The goal of purging is to ensure that no data remains, so commingling data should not be a concern, nor should the exposure of the data; only staff with the proper clearance should handle the systems! Finally, a DLP system should flag data based on labels, not on the system it comes from.

---

## Question 34
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Classification should be conducted based on the value of the data to the organization, its sensitivity, and the amount of harm that could result from exposure of the data. Cost should be considered when implementing controls and is weighed against the damage that exposure would create.

---

## Question 35
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Erasing, which describes a typical deletion process in many operating systems, typically removes only the link to the file and leaves the data that makes up the file itself. The data will remain in place but not indexed until the space is needed and it is overwritten. Degaussing works only on magnetic media, but it can be quite effective on it. Purging and clearing both describe more elaborate removal processes.

---

## Question 36
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
TLS is a modern encryption method used to encrypt and protect data in transit. BitLocker is a full-disk encryption technology used for data at rest. DES and SSL are both outdated encryption methods and should not be used for data that requires high levels of security.

---

## Question 37
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
We know that the data classification will not be the top-level classification of Confidential because the loss of the data would not cause severe damage and is not medical data covered by HIPAA. This means we have to choose between private (PHI) and sensitive (confidential). Calling this private due to the patient's personally identifiable information fits the classification scheme, giving us the correct answer.

---

## Question 38
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
A data loss prevention (DLP) system or software is designed to identify labeled data or data that fits specific patterns and descriptions to help prevent it from leaving the organization. An IDS is designed to identify intrusions. Although some IDS systems can detect specific types of sensitive data using pattern matching, they have no ability to stop traffic. A firewall uses rules to control traffic routing, while UDP is a network protocol.

---

## Question 39
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
When data is stored in a mixed classification environment, it is typically classified based on the highest classification of data included. In this case, the U.S. government's highest classification is Top Secret. Mixed classification is not a valid classification in this scheme.

---

## Question 40
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The end of support of a device or product typically occurs after the end of life and end of sales. Support may continue for a period of months or even years, but eventually support stops too. General availability is found during the main part of a life cycle, rather than at the end, and helps note when the product is out of testing and can be acquired or used by customers or others instead of specific groups like beta testers or early release partners.

---

## Question 41
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Tailoring ensures that assessment methods are appropriate to the systems, services, and other assets

that are being validated and is the best answer here. Scoping is a related term and involves setting the boundaries of security control implementations. Asset management involves how assets are overseen throughout their life cycle, and compliance is a broad term that describes ensuring that regulations, contractual terms, or other requirements are met.

---

## Question 42
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Group Policy provides the ability to monitor and apply settings in a security baseline. Manual checks by users and using start-up scripts provide fewer reviews and may be prone to failure, while periodic review of the baseline won't result in compliance being checked.

---

## Question 43
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Providing consent, or agreeing to data collection and use, is important in many data collection scenarios and may be required by law. Remanence occurs when data remains in place, sometimes inadvertently, after it should have been removed or disposed of. Retention is the intentional process of keeping and managing data. Certification is not a data life-cycle process element.

---

## Question 44
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Amy is a data custodian and is responsible for the technical environment, including things like database structures and the technical implementations of data policies. Some organizations may overlap other data roles, including data controllers or data stewards, but the best answer here is a data custodian. Amy is not a data user and is not a data processor who uses the data on behalf of a data controller.

---

## Question 45
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
A data loss prevention (DLP) system can tag, monitor, and limit where files are transferred to. Jim's company may also elect to use digital rights management tools in combination with a data loss prevention system, but DRM controls how data can be used, not where files are transferred to or where they exist at any point in time in most cases. An intrusion

prevention system (IPS) may be able to detect files that are being sent across a network but won't stop files from being copied on workstations or thumb drives. Antivirus is not designed for this purpose.

---

## Question 46
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Using strong encryption, like AES-256, can help ensure that loss of removable media like tapes doesn't result in a data breach. Security labels may help with handling processes, but they won't help once the media is stolen or lost. Having multiple copies will ensure that you can still access the data but won't increase the security of the media. Finally, using hard drives instead of tape only changes the media type and not the risk from theft or loss.

---

## Question 47
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Electronic signatures, as used in this rule, prove that the signature was provided by the intended signer. Electronic signatures as part of the FDA code are intended to ensure that electronic records are “trustworthy, reliable, and generally equivalent to paper records and handwritten signatures executed on paper.” Signatures cannot provide confidentiality or integrity and don't ensure that someone has reviewed the data.

---

## Question 48
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Tags that include information about the life span of the data and when it has expired can help with life- cycle management processes, part of data maintenance for organizations. Tags can be as simple as timestamps, or they can include additional metadata like the data type, creator, or purpose that can help inform the retention and disposal process. Rotation of files like logs is commonly done to limit how much space they take up, but rotation itself does not address disposal requirements and information that would guide the disposal process. DRM, or digital rights management,

and DLP, or data loss prevention, both address data security and use but not disposal.

---

## Question 49
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
During the data maintenance phase of a typical data life cycle, activities like data scrubbing occur to remove unneeded, incorrect, or out-of-date data. Data retention is not a phase; instead, it is a decision that organizations make based on requirements, laws, or their own needs. Data remanence is also not a phase. Data remanence describes the problem of data that remains after data is removed. Finally, in the data collection phase, data is acquired and may be scrubbed, but the question describes a process occurring after data is no longer needed, not during acquisition.

---

## Question 50
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Asset tagging is used to make sure that individuals working with assets can determine the security level or practices they require. Tailoring adjusts security requirements to organizational needs. Other controls, such as sanitization and encryption, may be required by a specific asset classification but are not sufficient to meet a full range of security requirements.

---

## Question 51
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Data labels are crucial to identify the classification level of information contained on the media, and labeling data at creation helps to ensure that it is properly handled throughout its life cycle. Digital rights management (DRM) tools provide ways to control how data is used, while encrypting it can help maintain the confidentiality and integrity of the data. Classifying the data is necessary to label it, but it doesn't automatically place a label on the data.

---

## Question 52
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
The NIST SP 800-88 process for sanitization and disposition shows that media that will be reused and was classified at a moderate level should be purged and then that purge should be validated. Finally, it should be documented.

---

## Question 53
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Data in transit is data that is traversing a network or is otherwise in motion. TLS, VPNs, and IPsec tunnels are all techniques used to protect data in transit. AES, Serpent, and IDEA are all symmetric algorithms, while Telnet, ISDN, and UDP are all protocols. BitLocker and FileVault are both used to encrypt data, but they protect only stored data, not data in transit.

---

## Question 54
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The data owner has ultimate responsibility for data belonging to an organization and is typically the CEO, president, or another senior employee. Business and mission owners typically own processes or programs. System owners own a system that processes sensitive data.

---

## Question 55
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The most difficult location to secure for encryption keys and similar highly sensitive information is in active memory because the data needs to be decrypted to be used. When data is at rest on a drive or in transit via either a local or public network, it can be encrypted until it reaches its destination, and you can use strong encryption in each of those circumstances.

---

## Question 56
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Chris is most likely to be responsible for classifying the data that he owns as well as assisting with or advising the system owners on security requirements and control selection. In an organization with multiple data owners, Chris is unlikely to set criteria for classifying data on his own. As a data owner, Chris will also not typically have direct responsibility for scoping, tailoring, applying, or enforcing those controls.

---

## Question 57
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The system administrators are acting in the roles of data administrators who grant access and will also act as custodians who are tasked with the day-to-day application of security controls. They are not acting as data owners who own the data itself. Typically, system administrators are delegated authority by system

owners, such as a department head, and of course they are tasked with providing access to users.

---

## Question 58
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Third-party organizations that process personal data on behalf of a data controller are known as data processors. The organization that they are contracting with would act in the role of the business or mission owners, and others within Chris's organization would have the role of data administrators, granting access as needed to the data based on their operational procedures and data classification.

---

## Question 59
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
While it can be a lot of work, the most complete inventory of active systems and devices can be created by determining what is connected to the network and then finding those assets. Port scans can help to find some systems, but firewalls and other security solutions can prevent systems from being discovered. Staff may not know about all of the systems and devices on the network or may presume that someone else will provide information about shared resources such as printers, security cameras, or other devices. Active Directory is unlikely to contain all devices, particularly if an inventory is needed!

---

## Question 60
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In most organizations, changing processes so that new systems and devices are added to inventory before they are deployed is the first step in making sure asset inventories are current. Yearly or quarterly updates are too infrequent for most organizations and will lead to gaps as devices are forgotten.

---

## Question 61
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Eric should use metadata tagging to allow him to use technical tools like DLP and DRM to handle and track data based on its type and content. File extensions do not reveal data security or type, and relying on network share locations to secure data or

inventory will lead to gaps in security as files are moved, copied, or stored locally.

---

## Question 62
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Patents, databases, and formulas are all examples of intangible assets. Tangible assets include things like hardware, cables, and buildings. Personnel assets include employees, and most organizations would be quite concerned if their employees were intangible!

---

## Question 63
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
There is no requirement that data collection be equal or equivalent. Instead, data collection statutes and other requirements often require that only required data is collected, that individuals are made aware of the data collection, and that they consent to the collection. Similarly, data should be collected only lawfully and via fair methods.

---

## Question 64
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Requiring all media to have a label means that when unlabeled media is found, it should immediately be considered suspicious. This helps to prevent mistakes that might leave sensitive data unlabeled. Prelabeled media is not necessarily cheaper (nor may it make sense to buy!), while reusing public media simply means that it must be classified based on the data it now contains. HIPAA does not have specific media labeling requirements.

---

## Question 65
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Data in use is data that is in a temporary storage location while an application or process is using it. Thus, data in memory is best described as data in use or ephemeral data. Data at rest is in storage, while data in transit is traveling over a network or other channel. Data at large is a made-up term.

---

## Question 66
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Validation processes are conducted to ensure that the sanitization process was completed, avoiding data remanence. A form like this one helps to ensure that each device has been checked and that it was properly

wiped, purged, or sanitized. This can allow reuse, does not prevent destruction, and does not help with attribution, which is a concept used with encryption to prove who created or sent a file.

---

## Question 67
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Ensuring that data cannot be recovered is difficult, and the time and effort required to securely and completely wipe media as part of declassification can exceed the cost of new media. Sanitization, purging, and clearing may be part of declassification, but they are not reasons that it is not frequently chosen as an option for organizations with data security concerns.

---

## Question 68
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Destruction is the final stage in the life cycle of media and can be done via disintegration, incineration, or a variety of other methods that result in the media and data being nonrecoverable. Sanitization is a combination of processes used when data is being removed from a system or media. Purging is an intense form of clearing, and degaussing uses strong magnetic fields to wipe data from magnetic media.

---

## Question 69
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
PHI is protected health information. Personally identifiable information (PII) is any information that can identify an individual. Proprietary data is information that helps organizations maintain a competitive edge or that they want to keep to their own organization or a controlled set of individuals. PID is not a term used for data classification.

---

## Question 70
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Handling requirements and tools include visual indicators like a distinctive screen background and can help employees remember what level of classification they are dealing with and thus the handling requirements that they are expected to follow.

---

## Question 71
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
If an organization allows media to be downgraded, the purging process should be followed, and then the

media should be relabeled. Degaussing may be used for magnetic media but won't handle all types of media. Pulverizing would destroy the media, preventing reuse, while relabeling first could lead to mistakes that result in media that hasn't been purged entering use.

---

## Question 72
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The data owner sets the rules for use and protection of data. The remaining options all describe tasks for the system owner, including implementation of security controls.

---

## Question 73
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
In the NIST SP 800-60 diagram, the process determines appropriate categorization levels resulting in security categorization and then uses that as an input to determine controls. Standard selection would occur at an organizational level, while baselining occurs when systems are configured to meet a baseline. Sanitization would require the intentional removal of data from machines or media.

---

## Question 74
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
A and E can both be expected to have data at rest. C, the Internet, is an unknown, and the data can't be guaranteed to be at rest. B, D, and F are all data in transit across network links.

---

## Question 75
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
B, D, and F all show network links. Of the answers provided, Transport Layer Security (TLS) provides the best security for data in motion. AES-256 and 3DES are both symmetric ciphers and are more likely to be used for data at rest. SSL has been replaced with TLS and should not be a preferred solution.

---

## Question 76
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Sending a file that is encrypted before it leaves means that exposure of the file in transit will not result in a confidentiality breach, and the file will remain secure until decrypted at location E. Since options A, C, and D do not provide any information about what happens at point C, they should be considered insecure,

as the file may be at rest at point C in an unencrypted form.

---

## Question 77
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Encrypting and labeling sensitive email will ensure that it remains confidential and can be identified. Performing these actions only on sensitive email will reduce the cost and effort of encrypting all email, allowing only sensitive email to be the focus of the organization's efforts. Only encrypting highly sensitive email not only skips labeling but might expose other classifications of email that shouldn't be exposed.

---

## Question 78
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Data retention policies can reduce the number of old logs and other files that may need to be produced during a legal case. That can reduce organizational risk, but retention policies need to be in place well before a legal hold is filed. Reducing storage in use does not reduce liability, but it can reduce financial costs, and data retention policies don't tend to limit the number of classifications in use. Legal penalties are not impacted by a retention policy.

---

## Question 79
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Systems used to process data are data processors. Data owners are typically CEOs or other very senior staff, custodians are granted rights to perform day-to- day tasks when handling data, and mission owners are typically program or information system owners.

---

## Question 80
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Personally identifiable information includes any information that can uniquely identify an individual. This would include name, Social Security number, and any other unique identifier (including a student ID number). ZIP code, by itself, does not uniquely identify an individual.

---

## Question 81
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Protected health information, or PHI, includes a variety of data in multiple formats, including oral and recorded data, such as that created or received by

healthcare providers, employers, and life insurance providers. PHI must be protected by HIPAA. PII is personally identifiable information. SHI and HPHI are both made-up acronyms.

## Question 82
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Tokenization replaces other data with a random string of characters. These tokens are then matched to the actual values for secure lookups as needed. Anonymization removes all personally identifiable data to ensure that the original subject cannot be identified. Data masking obscures some, but not all, data. Pseudonymization uses a pseudonym or alias to replace other information.

---

## Question 83
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, or PCI-DSS, is a credit card industry data security standard that defines how businesses must handle information related to credit cards. CC-Comply was made up for this question. GLBA, or Gramm-Leach- Bliley, modernized financial institution standards, and GDPR is an EU data privacy regulation.

---

## Question 84
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Due to problems with remnant data, the U.S. National Security Agency requires physical destruction of SSDs. This process, known as disintegration, results in very small fragments via a shredding process. Zero fill wipes a drive by replacing data with zeros, degaussing uses magnets to wipe magnetic media, and clearing is the process of preparing media for reuse.

---

## Question 85
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The data owner bears responsibility for categorizing information systems and delegates selection of controls to system owners, while custodians implement the controls. Users don't perform any of these actions, while business owners are tasked with ensuring that systems are fulfilling their business purpose.

---

## Question 86
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
PCI DSS provides a set of required security controls and standards. Step 2 would be guided by the requirements of PCI DSS. PCI DSS will not greatly influence step 1 because all of the systems handle credit card information, making PCI DSS apply to all systems covered. Steps 3 and 4 will be conducted after PCI DSS has guided the decisions in step 2.

---

## Question 87
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Custodians are tasked with the day-to-day monitoring of the integrity and security of data. Step 5 requires monitoring, which is a custodial task. A data owner may grant rights to custodians but will not be responsible for conducting monitoring. Data processors process data on behalf of the data controller, and a user simply uses the data via a computing system.

---

## Question 88
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Susan's organization is limiting its risk by sending drives that have been sanitized before they are destroyed. This limits the possibility of a data breach if drives are mishandled by the third party, allowing them to be stolen, resold, or simply copied. The destruction of the drives will handle any issues with data remanence, while classification mistakes are not important if the drives have been destroyed. Wiping the data before destruction does not make a meaningful difference for data retention policy concerns. Data permanence and the life span of the data are not important on a destroyed drive.

---

## Question 89
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
RFID tags are a common solution for tracking hardware assets and equipment. They can be queried wirelessly at varying ranges depending on the tags and may be built-in to handheld readers or even included in doorways or arches to track items as they enter or leave a facility. Visual inventory relies on staff checking items, MAC addresses are hardware addresses for networked devices, and not every asset in inventory is

likely to have a wireless network capability—or to be on! Steganography is hiding messages in images and doesn't help at all with inventory.

---

## Question 90
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Record retention is the process of retaining and maintaining information for as long as it is needed. A data storage policy describes how and why data is stored, while data storage is the process of actually keeping the data. Asset maintenance is a noninformation-security-related process for maintaining physical assets.

---

## Question 91
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The cost of the data is not directly included in the classification process. Instead, the impact on the organization if the data were exposed or breached is considered. Who can access the data and what regulatory or compliance requirements cover the data are also important considerations.

---

## Question 92
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Symmetric encryption like AES is typically used for data at rest. Asymmetric encryption is often used during transactions or communications when the ability to have public and private keys is necessary. DES is an outdated encryption standard, and OTP is the acronym for onetime password.

---

## Question 93
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Administrators have the rights to apply the permissions to access and handle data. Custodians are trusted with day-to-day data handling tasks. Business owners are typically system or project owners, and data processors are systems used to process data.

---

## Question 94
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Knowing the asset's owner also tells you who is responsible for protecting the asset or for delegating that task. While asset owners may be law enforcement contacts, this is not a critical item for asset security. It does not directly help you to establish the value of the asset or to set security classification levels for an asset.

---

## Question 95
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Tapes may be vulnerable to theft or loss in transit. That means tapes that are leaving their normal storage facility should be handled according to the organization's classification schemes and handling requirements. Purging the tapes would cause the loss of data, while increasing the classification level of the tapes does not align with the standard practices for data classification and handling. The tapes should be encrypted rather than decrypted.

---

## Question 96
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The correct answer is the tape that is being shipped to a storage facility. You might think that the tape in shipment is “in motion,” but the concept is that the data is not being accessed and is instead in storage rather than being sent across a network. Data in a TCP packet, in an e-commerce transaction, or in local RAM is in motion and is actively being used.

---

## Question 97
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
When the value of data changes due to legal, compliance, or business reasons, reviewing classifications and reclassifying the data is an appropriate response. Once the review is complete, data can be reclassified and handled according to its classification level. Simply relabeling the data avoids the classification process and may not result in the data being handled appropriately. Similarly, selecting a new baseline or simply encrypting the data may not handle all of the needs that the changes affecting the data create.

---

## Question 98
**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:**
Data owners, controllers, and custodians are typically found inside of a company, while data processors are typically third parties.

---

## Question 99
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Public data is just that—information that can be made public without any harm to the organization, and in fact, it is often information that the organization wants to make available. Private information should

stay private inside of an organization, sensitive data may cause damage to the mission of the organization if exposed, and proprietary or confidential information is the most sensitive data that an organization wants to protect.

---

## Question 100
**Correct Answer:** See Explanation

**Explanation:**
The data elements match with the categories as follows: Data elements 1. Medical records: B. PHI 2. Trade secrets A. Proprietary data 3. Social Security numbers: C. PII 4. Driver's license numbers: C. PII Medical records are an example of protected health information (PHI). Trade secrets are an example of proprietary data. Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers are examples of PII; if they were used in a medical context, they may also be PHI, but this question does not ask you to consider them in that context.

---

## Question 101
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Cloud access security brokers (CASBs) can be on- site or cloud-based and are security policy enforcement points that operate between users and cloud services. A CASB can provide insight into what users are doing, enforce policies, provide threat protection, and even provide data loss prevention capabilities. An SIEM collects logs and event information as part of security monitoring and event management. A DLP system focuses on data loss prevention and data security but won't address an organization's full set of security policies and practices in the cloud, and NGFWs, or next-generation firewalls, provide a variety of security

services but are not specifically designed to implement cloud policy.

---

## Question 102
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The devices have reached end of support (EOS), and the vendor will no longer provide updates or support for it. End of development occurs when no new software updates or patches are being released. End of life and end of sales often occur at the same time when the vendor no longer sells the device. Support will typically continue even after end of life (EOL).

---

## Question 103
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Asset owners are responsible for assets in an organization, including their procurement, management, and life cycle. Unlike data roles, there are typically fewer asset roles in play, and asset custodian is not a commonly recognized role. Since these are hardware devices, Gary's role is not as a data custodian or owner in the scope of this question.

---

## Question 104
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Modifying baselines to better suit an organization is known as tailoring. Scoping occurs when baselines are reviewed to ensure that only controls suited to the environment or system are used. Editing and defining are not terms used on the exam for these activities.

---

## Question 105
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Data location, particularly at rest, may drive compliance requirements based on local or national laws. This concern drives the majority of data location concerns. Ensuring data is not lost is a data handling and management practice topic, geographic location may be related to cost but storage media and services drive cost far more than physical location, and data custodians are likely to work with data regardless of location.
