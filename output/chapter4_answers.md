# CISSP Practice Tests - Chapter 4: Communication and Network Security (Domain 4) Answer Key

## Question 1
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
BitTorrent is an example of a peer-to-peer (P2P) content delivery network. It is commonly used for legitimate purposes to distribute large files like Linux ISOs and other freely distributed software packages and files in addition to its less legitimate uses. CloudFlare, CloudFront, and Akamai's Edge are all hosted CDNs.

---

## Question 2
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
VDOMs are instances of firewalls, each with their own interfaces and rulesets allowing granular configurations based on security requirements. VDOMs are commonly used to accommodate different purposes, customers, or other needs where separately managed firewall instances are desirable. They don't combine instances; instead, they create separate instances, they aren't domain controllers, and hosting multiple domain names does not require a VDOM.

---

## Question 3
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Ben is using ad hoc mode, which directly connects two clients. It can be easy to confuse this with stand- alone mode, which connects clients using a wireless access point but not to wired resources like a central network. Infrastructure mode connects endpoints to a central network, not directly to each other. Finally, wired extension mode uses a wireless access point to link wireless clients to a wired network.

---

## Question 4
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
A collision domain is the set of systems that could cause a collision if they transmitted at the same time. Systems outside a collision domain cannot cause a collision if they send at the same time. This is important, as the number of systems in a collision domain increases the likelihood of network congestion due to an increase in collisions. A broadcast domain is

the set of systems that can receive a broadcast from each other. A subnet is a logical division of a network, while a supernet is made up of two or more networks.

---

## Question 5
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
The RST flag is used to reset or disconnect a session. It can be resumed by restarting the connection via a new three-way handshake.

---

## Question 6
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
He should choose 802.11ax, which supports theoretical speeds up to 9.6 Gbps. 802.11ac supports up to 5.9 Gbps, 802.11n supports up to 600 Mbps, and 802.11g is only capable up to 54 Mbps.

---

## Question 7
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Both FTP/S and SFTP are commonly used as replacement insecure FTP services. SFTP offers the advantage of using SSH for transfers, making it easy to use existing firewall rules. TFTP is trivial FTP, an insecure quick transfer method often used to transfer files for network devices, among other uses. HFTPS and SecFTP were made up for this question.

---

## Question 8
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The Network layer, or layer 3, uses IP addresses for logical addressing. TCP and UDP protocols are used at the Transport layer, which is layer 4. Hardware addresses are used at layer 2, the Data Link layer, and sending and receiving bits via hardware is done at the Physical layer (layer 1).

---

## Question 9
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Most networks include many edge devices like wireless access points and edge switches. These devices often have a single power supply to balance cost against reliability and will simply be replaced if they fail. More critical devices like routers and core switches are typically equipped with redundant power supplies to ensure that larger segments of the network do not fail if a component fails. Of course, making sure devices are supported so they get updates and that

they are under warranty are both common practices for supportable networks.

---

## Question 10
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Brian is analyzing the jitter, which is the variance in delay between packets. This can indicate issues along the path the packets take. Latency is the time it takes a packet to reach its destination, throughput is a measure of the volume of traffic that can be sent, and signal to noise ratios compare the amount of desired information that is received versus the level of background noise or unwanted data.

---

## Question 11
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The Remote Access Dial In User Service (RADIUS) protocol was originally designed to support dial-up modem connections but is still commonly used for VPN- based authentication. HTTPS is not an authentication protocol. ESP and AH are IPsec protocols but do not provide authentication services for other systems.

---

## Question 12
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
SIPS, the secure version of the Session Initialization Protocol for VoIP, adds TLS encryption to keep the session initialization process secure. SVOIP and PBSX are not real protocols, but SRTP is the secure version of RTP, the Real time Transport Protocol.

---

## Question 13
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The firewall in the diagram has two protected zones behind it, making it a two-tier firewall design.

---

## Question 14
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Segmentation is a critical concept for network designers. Remote PCs that connect to a protected network need to comply with security settings and standards that match those required for the internal network. The VPN concentrator logically places remote users in the protected zone behind the firewall, but that means user workstations (and users) must be trusted in the same way that local workstations are.

---

## Question 15
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Micro-segmentation is used to logically separate systems and services by defining boundaries between

them. This is often part of a zero trust architecture including the use of on-demand access to services. Converged protocols implement other protocols over another protocol like iSCSI or InfiniBand over Ethernet. Physical segmentation uses separate physical devices and infrastructure to provide segmentation. Edge networks place computation and storage closer to the end user.

---

## Question 16
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) is used to allow multiple routing tables to exist in a virtual router, all working simultaneously as defined by network traffic rules. A VPC may include VRF capabilities, but VRF would still be required to complete this requirement. VLANs are used to separate network segments, not to provide routing, and a content distribution network is used to provide high- performance, denial-of-service-resistant content replication and access from a large-scale network of replicas.

---

## Question 17
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Disabling SSID broadcast can help prevent unauthorized personnel from attempting to connect to the network. Since the SSID is still active, it can be discovered by using a wireless sniffer. Encryption keys are not related to SSID broadcast, beacon frames are used to broadcast the SSID, and it is possible to have multiple networks with the same SSID.

---

## Question 18
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Software-defined networking (SDN) uses code to configure and control the network. This allows for agile, programmatic control and configuration as needed from a central control point. SD-WAN provides the same sort of control for wide area network links, which aren't mentioned in this question. Proxy routing occurs when a proxy server routes traffic between

clients and other systems, and agile networking is not a commonly used term.

---

## Question 19
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
iSCSI is a converged protocol that supports SCSI storage access via Ethernet. CXL is Compute Express Link, often used to interconnect memory, CPUs, and accelerators. SD-WAN is a software-defined wide area network, and Zigbee is a low-power wireless protocol.

---

## Question 20
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Peering allows you to connect directly to a provider's network at a peering location where they provide edge facilities. This can reduce ingress/egress costs as well as provide direct paths to their networks and services. Replication of data is not an artifact of or a result of peering. Controlling traffic flows via software-defined routes is done using SD-WAN, and hosting copies of sites at multiple locations is a typical result of using a CDN.

---

## Question 21
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Traffic sent between systems in the same data center is called east/west traffic since it does not flow across network boundaries. East/west traffic requires additional design work in many organizations if monitoring and other security is desired. Traffic that is external to the data center, either inbound or outbound, is called north/south traffic. Privileged/unprivileged and store/forward are not typically used to describe the traffic flows in the question.

---

## Question 22
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Multilayer protocols like Distributed Network Protocol (DNP3) allow SCADA and other systems to use TCP/IP-based networks to communicate. Many SCADA devices were never designed to be exposed to a network, and adding them to a potentially insecure network can create significant risks. TLS or other encryption can be used on TCP packets, meaning that even serial data can be protected. Serial data can be

carried via TCP packets because TCP packets don't care about their content; it is simply another payload. Finally, TCP/IP does not have a specific throughput as designed, so issues with throughput are device-level issues.

---

## Question 23
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
WPA3's simultaneous authentication of equals (SAE) mode improves on WPA2's pre-shared key (PSK) mode by allowing for secure authentication between clients and the wireless network without enterprise user accounts. If Ben needed to worry about support for WPA3, which may not be available to all systems that may want to connect, he might have to choose WPA2. A captive portal is often used with open guest networks but requires additional work to maintain, and Enterprise mode requires user accounts.

---

## Question 24
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
SMS messages are not encrypted, meaning that they could be sniffed and captured. While using two factors is more secure than a single factor, SMS is one of the less secure ways to implement two-factor authentication because of this. SMS messages can be spoofed, can be received by more than one phone, and are typically stored on the recipient's phone. The primary threat here, however, is the unencrypted message itself.

---

## Question 25
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
802.11ac operates in the 5 GHz range. The 900 MHz range has frequently been used for phones and non-Wi- Fi wireless networks as well as other amateur radio uses, and 2.4 GHz is used by 802.11n and other protocols. Knowing that multiple ranges are available and that they may behave differently based on how many access points are in use and whether other devices that may cause interference on that band are in the area can be important for wireless network deployments.

---

## Question 26
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
ARP and RARP operate at the Data Link layer, the second layer of the OSI model. Both protocols deal with physical hardware addresses, which are used above the Physical layer (layer 1) and below the Network layer (layer 3), thus falling at the Data Link layer.

---

## Question 27
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) is a converged protocol that allows location- independent file services over traditional network technologies. It costs less than traditional Fibre Channel. VoIP is Voice over IP, SDN is software-defined networking, and MPLS is Multiprotocol Label Switching, a technology that uses path labels instead of network addresses.

---

## Question 28
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
A repeater, switch, or concentrator will amplify the signal, ensuring that the 100-meter distance limitation of 1000BaseT is not an issue. A gateway would be useful if network protocols were changing, while Cat7 cable is appropriate for a 10 Gbps network at much shorter distances. STP cable is limited to 155 Mbps and 100 meters, which would leave Chris with network problems.

---

## Question 29
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The use of TCP port 80 indicates that the messaging service is using the HTTP protocol. Slack is a messaging service that runs over HTTPS, which uses port 443. SMTP is an email protocol that uses port 25.

---

## Question 30
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
HTTP traffic is typically sent via TCP80. Unencrypted HTTP traffic can be easily captured at any point between A and B, meaning that the messaging solution chosen does not provide confidentiality for the organization's corporate communications.

---

## Question 31
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
If a business need requires messaging, using a local messaging server is the best option. This prevents traffic from traveling to a third-party server and can

offer additional benefits such as logging, archiving, and control of security options like the use of encryption.

---

## Question 32
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Multilayer protocols create three primary concerns for security practitioners: they can conceal covert channels (and thus covert channels are allowed), filters can be bypassed by traffic concealed in layered protocols, and the logical boundaries put in place by network segments can be bypassed under some circumstances. Multilayer protocols allow encryption at various layers and support a range of protocols at higher layers.

---

## Question 33
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE), Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI), and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) are all examples of converged protocols that combine specialized protocols with standard protocols like TCP/IP. Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIIME) is not a converged protocol.

---

## Question 34
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
When a workstation or other device is connected simultaneously to both a secure network and a nonsecure network like the Internet, it may act as a bridge, bypassing the security protections located at the edge of a corporate network. It is unlikely that traffic will be routed improperly, leading to the exposure of sensitive data, as traffic headed to internal systems and networks is unlikely to be routed to the external network. Reflected DDoS attacks are used to hide identities rather than to connect through to an internal network, and security administrators of managed systems should be able to determine both the local and wireless IP addresses his system uses.

---

## Question 35
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Observability focuses on the ability to see how an entire system, service, or environment is performing and behaving based on its external outputs. That means that telemetry data—information about what

components are doing—is critical and will be gathered using logs, metrics, and real-time analysis. This means that centralizing and aggregating data, enabling alerts for critical errors, and implementing logging using standardized formats are all common practices. Feedback loops are also important, allowing administrators and others to take action when problems or issues are detected.

---

## Question 36
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
IPsec can provide encryption, access control, nonrepudiation, and message authentication using public key cryptography. It does not provide authorization, protocol convergence, content distribution, or the other items listed.

---

## Question 37
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Zigbee uses AES to protect network traffic, providing integrity and confidentiality controls. It does not use 3DES, and ROT13 is a simple rotational cipher you might find in a cereal box or secret decoder ring.

---

## Question 38
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The process of using a fake Media Access Control (MAC) address is called spoofing, and spoofing a MAC address already in use on the network can lead to an address collision, preventing traffic from reaching one or both systems. Tokens are used in token ring networks, which are outdated, and EUI refers to an Extended Unique Identifier, another term for MAC address, but token loss is still not the issue. Broadcast domains refer to the set of machines a host can send traffic to via a broadcast message.

---

## Question 39
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
While security features vary from provider to provider, encryption, device-based authentication (for example, using certificates), and SIM-based authentication are all common options for 4G connectivity solutions. Joanna should work with her provider to determine what capabilities are available and assess whether they meet her needs.

---

## Question 40
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Application-specific protocols are handled at layer 7, the Application layer of the OSI model.

---

## Question 41
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
AVPC, or virtual private cloud, is the environment many organizations operate inside of public clouds. They provide on-demand access to configurable, shared resources operated by the cloud provider inside of their isolated boundaries. VLANs are used to logically separate networks; SDN is software-defined networking, which is typically part of how a VPC is implemented; and CXL, or Compute Express Link, is a converged protocol used to connect CPUs, GPUs, accelerators, and other components at high speeds.

---

## Question 42
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
802.1x provides port-based authentication and can be used with technologies like the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). 802.11a is a wireless standard, 802.3 is the standard for Ethernet, and 802.15.1 was the original Bluetooth IEEE standard.

---

## Question 43
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
1000BaseT is capable of a 100-meter run according to its specifications. For longer distances and exterior runs, a fiber-optic cable is typically used in modern networks.

---

## Question 44
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Port security prevents unrecognized or unpermitted systems from connecting to a network port based on their MAC address. Cloning a permitted or legitimate MAC address attempts to bypass this. VLAN hopping and 802.1q trunking attacks attempt to access other subnets by encapsulating packets so they will be unwrapped and directed to the other subnet. Etherkiller prevention is not a security setting or control.

---

## Question 45
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Most modern applications support TLS throughout their communications allowing clients to securely connect to the service and to encrypt communications.

VPN, either in software or hardware form, will be more complex and unwieldy. Software-based VPN would be more flexible, and hardware-based VPN would be more expensive and more complex. SIPS and SRTP are appropriate for a VoIP environment but are not generally a complete solution for a modern multimedia collaboration platform like Microsoft Teams, Zoom, or WebEx.

---

## Question 46
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Zigbee is designed for this type of low-power, Internet of Things network, and would be the best option for Chris. Some versions of Bluetooth are designed to operate in low-power mode as well, but Bluetooth isn't in this list of answers. Wi-Fi requires more power, NFC is very short range and would not work across a building or room, and infrared requires line of sight and is rarely used for that reason.

---

## Question 47
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Separate, physically isolated Ethernet networks that require strong authentication are a commonly used out- of-band (OOB) option. While direct physical access is also an acceptable out-of-band option, it does not work well in a complex, production-oriented environment where devices may not be safe or easy to access. Web clients and nonstandard ports are not out-of-band options as described.

---

## Question 48
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
A content delivery network run by a major provider can handle large-scale DDoS attacks more easily than any of the other solutions. Using DDoS mitigation techniques via an ISP is the next most useful capability, followed by both increases in bandwidth and increases in the number of servers in the web application cluster.

---

## Question 49
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
PPTP, L2F, L2TP, and IPsec are the most common VPN protocols. TLS is also used for an increasingly large percentage of VPN connections and may appear at some point in the CISSP exam. PPP is a dial-up

protocol, LTP is not a protocol, and SPAP is the Shiva Password Authentication Protocol sometimes used with PPTP.

---

## Question 50
**Correct Answer:** A, B

**Explanation:**
Wayne should consider the use of a dedicated VLAN for VoIP devices to help separate them from other networked devices, and he should also require the use of SIPS and SRTP, both secure protocols that will keep his VoIP traffic encrypted. Requiring the use of VPN for all remote VoIP devices is not necessary if SIPS and SRTP are in use, and a specific IPS for VoIP is not a typical deployment in most organizations.

---

## Question 51
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The Physical layer includes electrical specifications, protocols, and standards that allow control of throughput, handling line noise, and a variety of other electrical interface and signaling requirements. The OSI layer doesn't have a Device layer. The Transport layer connects the Network and Session layers, and the Data Link layer packages packets from the network layer for transmission and receipt by devices operating on the Physical layer.

---

## Question 52
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
WPA3, the replacement for WPA2, adds security features including a new mode called simultaneous authentication of equals that replaces the pre-shared key mode from WPA2 with a more secure option. Overall, it provides security improvements but may not be immediately implemented due to time for hardware and software to fully support it. WPA2 has been the most commonly deployed wireless security standard having replaced WPA and WEP.

---

## Question 53
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Cut-through switching forwards packets as soon as the destination address is known without waiting for the rest of the frame to arrive. This means that packets are not checked for integrity before being forwarded, optimizing throughput and reducing latency at the

expense of error checking. Store-and-forward waits for the entire frame to allow it to be checked using a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) before forwarding it. Blind and forward switching were made up for this question.

---

## Question 54
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
The Transport layer provides logical connections between devices, including end-to-end transport services to ensure that data is delivered. Transport layer protocols include TCP, UDP, SSL, and TLS.

---

## Question 55
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Machine Access Control (MAC) addresses are the hardware address the machine uses for layer 2 communications. The MAC addresses include an organizationally unique identifier (OUI), which identifies the manufacturer. MAC addresses can be changed, so this is not a guarantee of accuracy, but under normal circumstances you can tell what manufacturer made the device by using the MAC address.

---

## Question 56
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
For long-term connections like backhaul networks, a point-to-point VPN that is connected at all times is the most common choice to ensure all traffic is secured. TLS and SSH are commonly used to tunnel data but require additional attention to ensure that all traffic is tunneled. On-demand VPNs are more commonly used by users than for a connection like a backhaul network link.

---

## Question 57
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Double NATing isn't possible with the same IP range; the same IP addresses cannot appear inside and outside a NAT router. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved, but only so they are not used and routable on the Internet, and changing to PAT would not fix the issue.

---

## Question 58
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
A Class B network holds 2^16 systems, and its default network mask is 255.255.0.0.

---

## Question 59
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Enabling waiting rooms allows hosts to allow only intended attendees for events and meetings. Unfortunately, passcodes are easily shared, resulting in Zoom bombing despite the security they appear to offer. Meeting links are automatically generated and randomized, preventing brute forcing, and HTTPS is enabled by default for meetings.

---

## Question 60
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Real-time fault monitoring for network devices and connections often relies on SNMP and ICMP-based monitoring capabilities. Netflow and syslog are more commonly used for diagnostic and analysis tasks.

---

## Question 61
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
VLAN hopping between the voice and computer VLANs can be accomplished when devices share the same switch infrastructure. Using physically separate switches can prevent this attack. Encryption won't help with VLAN hopping because it relies on header data that the switch needs to read (and this is unencrypted), while Caller ID spoofing is an inherent problem with VoIP systems. A denial of service is always a possibility, but it isn't specifically a VoIP issue, and a firewall may not stop the problem if it's on a port that must be allowed through.

---

## Question 62
**Correct Answer:** A, B, D

**Explanation:**
RFC 1918 defines three address ranges as private (nonroutable) IP address ranges: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. Any of these would work, but many organizations use the 192.168.0.0/16 range for smaller sites or opt to carve out sections of the 10.0.0.0/8 range for multiple remote sites.

---

## Question 63
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
A captive portal is a popular solution that you may be familiar with from hotels and coffee shops. They combine the ability to gather data from customers with an open network, so customer data will not be encrypted. This avoids the need to distribute network passwords but means that customers must ensure their

own traffic is encrypted if they are worried about security.

---

## Question 64
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
A UPS system, or uninterruptible power supply, is designed to provide backup power during brief power disruptions ranging from power sags and brownouts to temporary power failures. For a longer outage, Susan will still want a generator or even a secondary power feed from another power grid or provider if possible, but for this specific scenario, a UPS will meet her needs. Dual power supplies help when the concern is losing power from one power supply and would be a great idea for her most critical network devices, but it is rare to have dual power supplies for edge devices like access points or edge switches.

---

## Question 65
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Fiber-optic cable is best suited to running 100 gigabit speeds. Cat5e, Cat6, and coaxial cable are not rated to those speeds.

---

## Question 66
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Data streams are associated with the Application, Presentation, and Session layers. Once they reach the Transport layer, they become segments (TCP) or datagrams (UDP). From there, they are converted to packets at the Network layer, frames at the Data Link layer, and bits at the Physical layer.

---

## Question 67
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
If the devices still need to be in production but cannot be patched, Lucca's best option is to use a separate security device to protect them. It may be tempting to simply install a firewall on the device or to disable all the services it exposes to the network, but some devices may not have firewall software available, and even if they do, the underlying operating system may have vulnerabilities in its implementation of its network stack or other software that even a firewall could not protect. Unplugging devices that are needed

for protection does not resolve the need to keep them online.

---

## Question 68
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Software-defined networking provides a network architecture that can be defined and configured as code or software and separates routing processes from packet switching while centralizing control. The 5-4-3 rule is an old design rule for networks that relied on repeaters or hubs. A converged network carries multiple types of traffic like voice, video, and data. A hypervisor-based network may be software defined, but it could also use traditional network devices running as virtual machines.

---

## Question 69
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Encapsulation adds to the header (and sometimes to the footer) of the data provided by the previous layer. The main body of the data is not modified, and encryption may happen but does not always happen.

---

## Question 70
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
A broken network cable is a layer 1 problem. If you encounter a problem like this and aren't sure, look for the answer that has a different situation or set of assumptions. Here you have three questions that occur at the network (layer 3), all of which have software or protocol implications. A broken network cable is a completely different type of issue and should stand out. Be careful, though! The exam is likely to give you two potentially valid answers to choose from, so work to get rid of the two least likely answers and spend your time on the remaining options.

---

## Question 71
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Network segmentation can reduce issues with performance as well as diminish the chance of broadcast storms by limiting the number of systems in a segment. This decreases broadcast traffic visible to each system and can reduce congestion. Segmentation can also help provide security by separating functional groups that don't need to be able to access each other's

systems. Installing a firewall at the border would only help with inbound and outbound traffic, not cross- network traffic. Spanning tree loop prevention helps prevent loops in Ethernet networks (for example, when you plug a switch into a switch via two ports on each), but it won't solve broadcast storms that aren't caused by a loop or security issues. Encryption might help prevent some problems between functional groups, but it won't stop them from scanning other systems, and it definitely won't stop a broadcast storm!

---

## Question 72
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Bandwidth describes the maximum amount of data that can be sent via a connection or network in a given period of time, and throughput describes the actual amount of traffic that is sent via the network or connection in a given period of time. The terms are not interchangeable but are closely related.

---

## Question 73
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
In an IaaS environment, the company that provides the cloud environment has final control of all the virtual machines and networks. Thus, to protect data, the best option is to encrypt the data. Unfortunately, Ben cannot fully ensure that traffic in his environment is not being captured and must rely on the cloud hosting provider for that assurance. While preventing the installation of packet sniffers and taps and ensuring that promiscuous mode cannot be enabled are useful habits in an environment that you control, this will not provide the same control in a cloud environment.

---

## Question 74
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
Using the same IP range for an on-site and cloud- hosted data center can be helpful when designing a flat network, but addresses must be carefully managed and allocated even in a space as big as the 10.0.0.0/24 range. If addresses are not properly managed, conflicts may arise that could disrupt production services. MAC address conflicts should not arise unless addresses are

manually changed or virtual machines are replicated without changing their MAC addresses. There is nothing in the problem to suggest routing issues.

---

## Question 75
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
A software-defined wide area network, or SD-WAN, is commonly used to manage multiple ISPs and other connectivity options to ensure speed, reliability, and bandwidth design goals are all met. Ben can use SD- WAN capabilities to accomplish his goals to make his hybrid cloud environment successful. Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) is a storage protocol; VXLAN is used for extensible virtual LANs, not WANs; and LiFi uses visible and infrared light to transfer data.

---

## Question 76
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Traffic entering and leaving a network is often called north/south traffic. East/west traffic is traffic between systems inside of a network. Foreign/domestic is not a commonly used term, and trusted/untrusted cannot be determined without additional information.

---

## Question 77
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
CXL, or Compute Express Link, is a converged protocol that is an open standard for high-speed communications with accelerators, GPUs, CPUs, and similar devices. VoIP is a telephony protocol, CDNs are content distribution networks, and iSCSI is a converged storage protocol.

---

## Question 78
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Fiber-optic cable is the most difficult of the listed types of network to capture data from without specialized equipment. Given access to a fiber-optic cable and specialized equipment to tap it, or with access to the endpoints of a fiber-optic cable and an optical tap, access can still be obtained. In either case, disruption may be observed when the cable is cut, spliced, or disconnected, and many attackers will not have access, skills, or the tools needed to do so. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth traffic can be captured using standard wireless cards and tools, and data carried by twisted-

pair Ethernet cables is easily captured using commodity tools.

---

## Question 79
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Buried fiber-optic cable is best suited to long distances, particularly when there are trees or other obstacles blocking line of sight that may interfere with Wi-Fi or LiFi deployments. Ethernet's distance limitations mean that repeaters would need to be powered, and there is no description of other structures or power along the path.

---

## Question 80
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Endpoint security solutions face challenges due to the sheer volume of data that they can create. When each workstation is generating data about events, this can be a massive amount of data. Endpoint security solutions should reduce the number of compromises when properly implemented, and they can also help by monitoring traffic after it is decrypted on the local host. Finally, non-TCP protocols are relatively uncommon on modern networks, making this a relatively rare concern for endpoint security system implementations.

## Question 81
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a loopback address and will resolve to the local machine. Public addresses are non–RFC 1918, nonreserved addresses. RFC 1918 addresses are reserved and include ranges like 10.x.x.x. An APIPA address is a self-assigned address used when a DHCP server cannot be found.

## Question 82
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Since Bluetooth doesn't provide strong encryption, it should only be used for activities that are not confidential. Bluetooth PINs are four-digit codes that often default to 0000. Turning it off and ensuring that your devices are not in discovery mode can help prevent Bluetooth attacks.

## Question 83
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The assignment of endpoint systems to VLANs is normally performed by a network switch.

---

## Question 84
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Infiniband over Ethernet is commonly used for purposes like this, allowing direct memory access over Ethernet while providing high bandwidth and low latency. iSCSI is used for storage, VoIP is used for telephony, and Compute Express Link (CXL) is used for CPU to device and CPU to memory connections.

---

## Question 85
**Correct Answer:** A, B, C

**Explanation:**
SD-WAN implementations typically perform all of these functions, combining active data collection via monitoring and response via self-learning and machine intelligence techniques and then applying predefined rules to take action to make the network perform as desired. SD-WAN does not imply or require that all connections are managed by the organization's primary Internet service provider. In fact, SD-WANs are often used to handle multiple ISPs to allow for failover and redundancy.

## Question 86
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
The OSI layers in order from layer 1 to layer 7 are as follows: 1. Physical 2. Data Link 3. Network 4. Transport 5. Session 6. Presentation 7. Application

## Question 87
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Valerie is most likely trying to prevent content addressable memory (CAM) table or MAC address table flooding by preventing large numbers of MAC addresses from being used on a single port. If CAM table flooding is successful, switches will not know where to send traffic and resort to sending all traffic to

every port, potentially exposing traffic to attackers. IP spoofing and VLAN hopping are not prevented by port security, which focuses on hardware (MAC) addresses. MAC aggregation was made up for this question.

---

## Question 88
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
A pre-admit, client-based NAC system will test systems before they are allowed on the network using a client that can determine more about a system than a clientless model can. Postadmission tests after clients are already on the network and clientless versions are useful when installing clients isn't possible for systems.

---

## Question 89
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
An active/active pair can use the full throughput capability of both devices, but normal deployment models will design to the maximum throughput of a single device to avoid disruption in the event that one of the pair fails. Active/passive designs can only handle the throughput of a single device and allow the secondary device to remain ready to operate but not passing traffic until it is needed. Line interactive is a term often used to describe UPS systems that filter power instead of passing it through, and near-line is a term used to describe backups that are not online but can be retrieved relatively quickly.

---

## Question 90
**Correct Answer:** A

**Explanation:**
A VPN that allows access to secured VLANs is the most common security design for this type of infrastructure. This allows secured remote access while protecting IoT devices that are often unable to be properly secured and thus cannot be trusted on a more exposed network. IPS does not provide remote access, and private IP addresses alone do not provide a protected network. DLP is used to prevent data exfiltration and won't stop other attacks or provide remote management access. iSCSI is a storage protocol, not a security solution. A VPN and jump boxes

are useful, but the devices would not be provided with additional security by iSCSi.

---

## Question 91
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Most existing satellite internet systems have relatively high latency. Newer low Earth orbit satellites like Starlink appear to provide better latency than higher orbits, but latency and susceptibility to interference from weather are both common concerns for satellite-based systems.

---

## Question 92
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
The application plane of a software-defined network (SDN) is where applications run that use application programming interfaces (APIs) to communicate with the SDN about needed resources. The control plane receives instructions and sends them to the network. The last common plane is the data plane, which forwards devices handling data and takes inputs from the control plane. The monitoring plane is not a common layer in an SDN environment.

---

## Question 93
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Common drawbacks of multilayer protocols are that they can bypass filters, allow or create covert channels, and allow network segment boundaries to be bypassed. The ability to operate at higher OSI layer levels is normally considered a benefit.

---

## Question 94
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
In order, the layers are Application layer, Transport layer, Internet layer, and Network Access layer.

---

## Question 95
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
Content distribution networks are used to both improve performance and reduce the impacts of denial- of-service attacks. Load-balanced server clusters may be part of the underlying design, but a CDN will more completely address Aadita's needs at the scale described. Micro-segmentation is used to isolate systems and services, not to address multiregion content accessibility and denial-of-service issues. A VPC

may be part of a solution, but nothing about a VPC makes it a sufficient solution on its own.

---

## Question 96
**Correct Answer:** B, C

**Explanation:**
5G technology includes both a new mutual authentication capability and additional protections for subscriber identities. It does not have specific anti- jamming security features and does not specifically use multifactor authentication.

---

## Question 97
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
Virtual eXtensible LAN (VXLAN) tunnels layer 2 connections over a layer 3 network, in essence extending a LAN over distances or networks that it might not otherwise function over. It does not remove the distance limitations of Ethernet cables, nor does it allow multiple subnets to use the same IP space—that requires NAT or other technologies that remap addresses to avoid conflicts.

---

## Question 98
**Correct Answer:** B

**Explanation:**
VLANs can be used to logically separate groups of network ports while still providing access to an uplink. Per-room VPNs would create significant overhead for support as well as create additional expenses. Port security is used to limit what systems can connect to ports, but it doesn't provide network security between systems. Finally, while firewalls might work, they would add expense and complexity without adding any benefits over a VLAN solution.

---

## Question 99
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
MAC addresses and their organizationally unique identifiers are used at the Data Link layer to identify systems on a network. The Application and Session layers don't care about physical addresses, while the Physical layer involves electrical connectivity and handling physical interfaces rather than addressing.

---

## Question 100
**Correct Answer:** C

**Explanation:**
This diagram shows the use of the Session Initialization Protocol (SIP) instead of SIP Secure (SIPS), meaning that SIP is not encrypted. Fortunately,

the voice data via the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) is encrypted. Mikayla should look into using SIPS in addition to SRTP.

---

## Question 101
**Correct Answer:** D

**Explanation:**
Air-gaps are physical separations between systems or devices that prevent communications or connections between them. This prevents network-based attacks and limits the ways that attackers could access the devices. Store-and-forward stores communications and send them after checking for errors. In-band administration occurs over existing interfaces or connections; out-of-band administration uses a separate network or management interface.
